    <h3 class="background">Background</h3>
    <p class="background">
      These culturally sensitive bi-lingual Gospel outlines are all based on the
      <i>Four Spiritual Laws</i> by Bill Bright.
    </p>
    <p class="background">
      Each outline was reviewed by a local ministry of Campus Crusade for Christ
      where the language is widely spoken. Many have modified the American
      outline to more clearly communicate the truth of the Gospel to their local
      culture. We have now back-translated their work into English, preserving
      the cultural adaptations that the outline has already gone through. This
      gives you the correct logic, relevant issues, and appropriate Bible verses
      for each language group.
    </p>
    <p class="background">
      Each outline now finishes with links to websites with further information
      about Jesus in their language. The link to mylanguage.net.au will bring
      them in touch with internet evangelists who are ready to answer their
      questions in their heart language.
    </p>
    <h3 class="background">Printed Copies</h3>
