      A life of faith will enable you to trust God increasingly with every detail of your life, and to practice the following:
</p>

<ul><li  dir = "ltr"  align = "left"  class = "style1">Read God's Word daily. (see Acts 17:11) Begin with the Gospel of John.</li></ul>

<p  dir = "ltr"  align = "left"  class = "style1">God's Word instructs us not to forsake "the assembling of ourselves together" (Hebrews 10:25). Several logs burn brightly together, but put one aside on the cold hearth and the fire goes out. So it is with your relationship with other Christians. If you do not belong to a church, do not wait to be invited. Take the initiative; call the pastor of a nearby church where Christ is honored and His Word is preached. Start this week, and make plans to attend regularly.</p>
